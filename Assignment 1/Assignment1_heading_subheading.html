        <h1> Exercise </h1>
            <p>
                Exercise is physical activity that is planned, structured, and repetitive for the purpose of conditioning the body. Exercise consists of cardiovascular conditioning, strength and resistance training, and flexibility.
                Exercise is essential for improving overall health, maintaining fitness, and helping to prevent the development of obesity , hypertension , and cardiovascular disease. Surveys conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicate that 61.5 percent of children aged nine to 13 years do not participate in any organized physical activity (for example, sports , dance classes) and 22.6 percent are not physically active during their free time. According to the American Obesity Association, approximately 30 percent of children and adolescents aged six to 19 years are overweight and 15 percent are obese.

        <h2> Cardiovascular conditioning </h2>
            <p>
                Cardiovascular conditioning involves moderate to vigorous physical activity that results in an elevated heart rate for a sustained period of time. Regular cardiovascular exercise improves the efficiency of the functioning of the heart, lungs, and circulatory system. For adults, aerobic exercise within a target heart rate range calculated based on a maximum heart rate by age is recommended. For healthy children, cardiovascular exercise that elevates the heart rate to no greater than a maximum heart rate of 200 beats per minute is recommended.

                In general, the American Heart Association recommends at least 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity every day for children and adolescents. Cardiovascular conditioning activities should be appropriate for the age, gender, and emotional status of the child. Examples of exercise that elevates the heart rate are bicycle riding, running, swimming, jumping rope, brisk walking, dancing, soccer, and basketball.

         <h3> Stress and Resistance training </h3>
            <p>
               Strength and resistance training increases muscle strength and mass, bone strength, and the body's metabolism. Strengthening exercises increase muscle strength by putting more strain on a muscle than it is normally accustomed to receiving. Strength training can be performed with or without special equipment. Strength/resistance training equipment includes handheld dumbbells, resistance machines (Nautilus, Cybex), and elastic bands. Strength training can also be performed without equipment; exercises without equipment include pushups, abdominal crunches, and squats. Children as young as six years can participate in strength training with weights, provided they are supervised by a fitness professional trained in youth strength training. Child-sized resistance machines may be available at some fitness facilities. According to youth strength training guidelines, children and adolescents should perform strength training for approximately 20 minutes two or three times weekly on nonconsecutive days.
